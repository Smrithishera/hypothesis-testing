# Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis Testing is a statistical technique used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. It begins with a null hypothesis (H0), which assumes no effect or no difference, and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which suggests the presence of an effect or a difference. The process involves analyzing the sample data to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, depending on the probability of obtaining the observed data if the null hypothesis were true.

The dataset is based on the performance of two themes on a website. Our task is to find which theme performs better using Hypothesis Testing.
